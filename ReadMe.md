<p align="justify">I implemented the concept of encoding and decoding of strings in my project, mainly I made this for getting direct link for torrent magnet sites without seeing through all those ads.</p>
<p align="justify">You can also use this simple salt your string statements which you can directly use in webpage, the encoded strings are automatically will be shown in browser in a decoded form.</p>

## **Here's an example**
<p align="justify">I can use this salting method to make peoples mandatorily use the specified website to get redirected.</p>

```
https://www.example.com/redirected?=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F
```

The `https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F` is in encoded form.

### **After Decoding**

```
https://www.example.com/redirected?=https://www.google.com/
```

https://www.google.com/
```
